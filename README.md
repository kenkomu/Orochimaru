## DESCRIPTION ##
This project aims to develop a full-featured Snake game using the Piston game engine in Rust. This game will serve as an application of everything learned thus far in Rust, including understanding and implementing Rust's Namespace and Library systems. The project will provide an opportunity to explore and integrate Rust libraries, reinforcing Rust programming skills and expanding knowledge of game development.
